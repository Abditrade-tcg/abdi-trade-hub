## üö® GitHub PAT Issue Persists

The GitHub Personal Access Token is still causing permission issues when trying to connect the repository. This is likely due to:

1. **Organization webhook permissions** - The PAT may not have sufficient organization-level permissions
2. **Repository webhook access** - Specific webhook creation permissions missing
3. **Organization admin requirements** - May need organization owner approval

---

## ‚úÖ **Solution Options**

### Option 1: Manual Deploy (Recommended for now)
Since we have the app created, we can deploy manually:

1. **Build your project locally:**
   ```powershell
   cd "c:\Users\celzy\Desktop\abditrade-frontend2.0"
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Create deployment zip:**
   ```powershell
   # Compress the build output
   Compress-Archive -Path "out\*" -DestinationPath "amplify-deploy.zip" -Force
   ```

3. **Deploy via AWS Console:**
   - Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home/apps/d2l066fpea7xoo
   - Use manual deployment option
   - Upload the zip file

### Option 2: Fix GitHub Organization Permissions
Contact the **Abditrade-tcg organization owner** to:
1. Make you an organization admin
2. Or have them create the PAT with full admin permissions
3. Grant webhook creation permissions at the org level

### Option 3: Use AWS Console to Connect Repository
1. **Go to:** https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home/apps/d2l066fpea7xoo
2. **Try connecting repository through the web interface**
3. **Use OAuth through the browser** instead of CLI token

---

## üéØ **Recommended Next Steps**

**Let's try Option 3 first** (AWS Console connection):

1. **Open:** https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home/apps/d2l066fpea7xoo
2. **Click:** "Connect repository" or "Host web app"
3. **Choose:** GitHub
4. **Authenticate through browser** (this might work better than CLI)
5. **Select:** Abditrade-tcg/abditrade-frontend2.0
6. **Configure:** Build settings and environment variables

---

## üîÑ **Environment Variables to Set**

When you connect the repository, make sure to add these environment variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=us-east-2_JQyLM7wLQ
NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=tubrda7vo3mfajca930arr44p
NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_REGION=us-east-2
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-nextauth-secret
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://d2l066fpea7xoo.amplifyapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_REGION=us-east-2
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-stripe-key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your-stripe-secret
DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
POKEMON_TCG_API_KEY=your-pokemon-key
```

## üóëÔ∏è **Clean Up Old App (Later)**

Once the new app is working:
1. **Go to old app:** https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home/apps/darg9t6uuyev5
2. **Delete the old app** to avoid confusion and costs
3. **Update domain** if you have a custom domain

---

## üéâ **Success!**

We've successfully created a new Amplify app! The GitHub connection issue is just a permission problem that can be resolved through the web console or by getting proper organization permissions.

Try the AWS Console connection method first - it often works better than CLI for organization repositories.
