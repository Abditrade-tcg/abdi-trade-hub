# ðŸš¨ GitHub PAT Permission Issue - Solution

## Error Analysis
The error message indicates: **"Resource not accessible by personal access token"** with status 403.

This means your GitHub Personal Access Token needs additional permissions for organization repositories.

---

## âœ… **Solution 1: Update GitHub PAT Permissions**

### Go back to GitHub and update your token:
1. **Go to:** https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. **Find your token:** `AWS Amplify - AbdiTrade` (or create a new one)
3. **Update scopes - Make sure these are ALL checked:**
   - âœ… `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
   - âœ… `admin:repo_hook` (Full control of repository hooks) 
   - âœ… `admin:org_hook` (Full control of organization hooks)
   - âœ… `read:org` (Read org and team membership)
   - âœ… `write:org` (Write org and team membership)

### **IMPORTANT:** Organization Access
4. **Scroll down to "Organization access"**
5. **Find "Abditrade-tcg"** 
6. **Click "Grant"** or **"Request"** access
7. If you're not an org admin, you may need to ask the org owner to approve

---

## âœ… **Solution 2: Alternative - Use Organization Admin Token**

If you're not the organization admin:
1. Ask the **Abditrade-tcg organization admin** to create a PAT
2. They need to generate it with admin access to the organization
3. Use their token instead

---

## âœ… **Solution 3: SSH Key Method (Alternative)**

Instead of HTTPS with PAT, we can try using SSH:

### Update command to use SSH URL:
```powershell
aws amplify update-app --app-id darg9t6uuyev5 --repository git@github.com:Abditrade-tcg/abditrade-frontend2.0.git --profile admin
```

---

## âœ… **Solution 4: Create New Amplify App (Recommended)**

Given the complexity with repository permissions, the easiest solution might be:

### Create fresh Amplify app:
```powershell
# Create new app
aws amplify create-app --name "abditrade-frontend2.0" --repository https://github.com/Abditrade-tcg/abditrade-frontend2.0 --oauth-token YOUR_NEW_TOKEN --profile admin

# Then create branch
aws amplify create-branch --app-id NEW_APP_ID --branch-name main --profile admin
```

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Recommended Next Steps**

**I recommend Solution 1 first:**

1. **Update your GitHub PAT permissions** (especially organization access)
2. **Generate a new token** if needed: https://github.com/settings/tokens
3. **Make sure you have organization admin rights** or request access
4. **Try the command again** with the updated token

### New Token Generation:
- **Name:** `AWS Amplify - AbdiTrade (Updated)`
- **Scopes:** `repo`, `admin:repo_hook`, `admin:org_hook`, `read:org`, `write:org`
- **Organization:** Grant access to **Abditrade-tcg**

### Then retry:
```powershell
aws amplify update-app --app-id darg9t6uuyev5 --repository https://github.com/Abditrade-tcg/abditrade-frontend2.0 --oauth-token YOUR_NEW_TOKEN --profile admin
```

## ðŸ’¡ **Quick Check**

Before creating a new token, verify:
1. Are you an admin of the **Abditrade-tcg** organization?
2. Is the **abditrade-frontend2.0** repository public or do you have access?
3. Does your current GitHub account have the necessary permissions?

Let me know what permissions you have, and I can guide you to the best solution!
