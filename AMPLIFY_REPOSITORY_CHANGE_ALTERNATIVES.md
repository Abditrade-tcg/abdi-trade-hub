# üö® AWS Amplify Repository Change - Alternative Methods

## Issue: No Direct Repository Edit Option

I can see from your screenshot that the repository URL is displayed as read-only text without an edit button. This is common in AWS Amplify when the repository connection is managed through GitHub integration.

## ‚úÖ **Method 1: Disconnect and Reconnect (Recommended)**

### Step 1: Disconnect Current Repository
1. In your current Amplify console page, look for a **"Disconnect"** or **"Disconnect repository"** button
2. If you don't see it on this page, try going to:
   - **App settings** ‚Üí **General** 
   - Or **Hosting** ‚Üí **General**
3. Look for a section that says **"Repository"** or **"Source"**
4. Click **"Disconnect"** or **"Edit"** next to the repository information

### Step 2: Reconnect with New Repository
1. After disconnecting, you should see **"Connect repository"** button
2. Choose **GitHub** as your repository provider
3. Select your organization: **Abditrade-tcg**
4. Choose repository: **abditrade-frontend2.0**
5. Select branch: **main** (or whatever your default branch is)
6. Click **"Next"** and **"Save and deploy"**

## ‚úÖ **Method 2: Create New Amplify App (If Method 1 fails)**

Sometimes it's easier to create a fresh Amplify app:

### Step 1: Create New App
1. Go to AWS Amplify main page: https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/
2. Click **"New app"** ‚Üí **"Host web app"**
3. Choose **GitHub**
4. Select **Abditrade-tcg/abditrade-frontend2.0**
5. Choose branch: **main**
6. App name: **abditrade-frontend2.0** (or keep existing name)

### Step 2: Configure Build Settings
1. Amplify will auto-detect your `amplify.yml`
2. Review the build settings
3. Click **"Next"**

### Step 3: Add Environment Variables
Copy these from your old app:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=us-east-2_JQyLM7wLQ
NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=tubrda7vo3mfajca930arr44p
NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_REGION=us-east-2
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=[your-secret]
NEXTAUTH_URL=[your-domain]
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_REGION=us-east-2
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=[your-key]
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=[your-secret]
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=[your-key]
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=[your-secret]
DATABASE_URL=[your-url]
POKEMON_TCG_API_KEY=[your-key]
```

### Step 4: Deploy and Test
1. Click **"Save and deploy"**
2. Wait for build to complete
3. Test your application

### Step 5: Update Domain (if you have custom domain)
1. Go to **Domain management**
2. Add your custom domain
3. Update DNS records as instructed

### Step 6: Delete Old App (after verification)
1. Only after verifying new app works
2. Go to old app ‚Üí **App settings** ‚Üí **General**
3. Scroll down and click **"Delete app"**

## ‚úÖ **Method 3: GitHub Repository Rename/Transfer**

Alternative approach - change the repository itself:

### Option A: Rename Repository
1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/Abditrade-tcg/abditrade-web
2. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **General**
3. Scroll to **Repository name**
4. Rename from `abditrade-web` to `abditrade-frontend2.0`
5. AWS Amplify will automatically follow the rename

### Option B: Transfer Content
1. Copy all files from `abditrade-frontend2.0` to `abditrade-web`
2. Push changes to `abditrade-web`
3. This keeps the same repository but updates the content

## üéØ **Recommended Next Steps**

Based on your screenshot, try this order:

1. **First**, look for a **"Disconnect"** button on the current page or in **App settings** ‚Üí **General**
2. **If no disconnect option**, try **Method 2** (create new app)
3. **If you want to keep things simple**, try **Method 3** (rename the GitHub repository)

---

## üîç **Where to Look for Disconnect Button**

In your Amplify console, check these locations:
- Current page you're on - scroll down for more options
- **App settings** ‚Üí **General** (main app settings page)
- **Hosting** ‚Üí **App settings** 
- **Hosting** ‚Üí **Branch settings**

Look for text like:
- "Disconnect repository"
- "Edit repository" 
- "Change source"
- "Repository settings"

---

## üí° **Quick Test**

Before doing anything major, try going to:
**Your Amplify App** ‚Üí **App settings** ‚Üí **General** 

Look for a **"Repository"** section that might have different options than the branch settings page you're currently viewing.

Let me know what options you see there!
