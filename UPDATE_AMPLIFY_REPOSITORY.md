## üîç Verification Steps

After updating the repository:

1. **Check Amplify Console:**
   - Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home/apps/darg9t6uuyev5
   - Verify the repository shows: `abditrade-frontend2.0`
   - Check that a new build has started

2. **Monitor Build Progress:**
   - Watch the build logs for any errors
   - Ensure all environment variables are properly set
   - Verify the build completes successfully

3. **Test Your Application:**
   - Visit your Amplify domain
   - Test key functionality (login, navigation, etc.)
   - Check browser console for any errors

## üö® If You Encounter Issues

### "Access denied" or "Repository not found"
1. Ensure the repository is public or AWS Amplify has access
2. Verify the repository URL is correct
3. Check GitHub permissions for AWS Amplify app

### "Build failed"
1. Check that `amplify.yml` exists in the new repository
2. Verify all environment variables are set in Amplify console
3. Review build logs for specific error messages

### "Environment variables missing"
Make sure these are set in your Amplify app settings:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID`
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
