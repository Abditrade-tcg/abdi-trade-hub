## Expected Behavior

### Post Type Display
- **Discussion**: No special badge, just the post content
- **Trade**: Should have üîÑ or "Trade" badge
- **Buy**: Should have "Looking to Buy" indicator
- **Sell**: Should have üí∞ or "For Sale" badge and price if provided

### Card Data
When a card is selected for Trade/Buy/Sell posts:
- Card data is sent to API in `cardData` field
- Backend stores: id, name, game, set, rarity, image, price
- Posts can be filtered/displayed differently based on postType

### API Request Format
```json
{
  "content": "Your post message here",
  "postType": "trade", // "discussion", "trade", "buy", or "sell"
  "cardData": {
    "id": "card-id",
    "name": "Charizard",
    "game": "Pokemon",
    "set": "Base Set",
    "rarity": "Holo Rare",
    "image": "https://...",
    "price": "$100.00"
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Modal Doesn't Open
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify you're a member of the guild (isJoined = true)
3. Hard refresh with Ctrl + F5

### Card Search Returns No Results
1. Check browser console for API errors
2. Verify `/api/cards` endpoint exists
3. Check guild category matches card game (Pokemon/Magic/etc.)
4. Ensure backend card API is configured

### Post Type Not Showing
1. Check that post was created with correct `postType` field
2. Verify backend is storing postType correctly
3. Check post display logic filters by postType

### Selected Card Not Displaying
1. Check that `selectedCard` state is set correctly
2. Verify card has `image` field with valid URL
3. Check CSS classes for card preview section

### Search Results Look Wrong
1. Verify backend returns cards in expected format
2. Check that `searchResults` array is populated
3. Inspect card object structure in console

## Notes

- The active route `/guilds/[id]` now points to `src/pages/guilds/[id].tsx` with all enhanced features
- Card search uses the guild's category as the game parameter automatically
- Post type is always sent to backend as lowercase (discussion, trade, buy, sell)
- Card data is only attached for Trade, Buy, and Sell post types
